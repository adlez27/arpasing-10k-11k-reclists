# Experimental ARPAsing Recording Scripts
Sometime in 2018, Kanru Hua released PDF files for two additional experimental ARPAsing reclists. The publicly distributed 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 reclists were modified to have 5 digit numbers in order to be compatible. Thanks to [@Slidingwall](https://github.com/Slidingwall) the additional reclists have been transcribed, and will be prepared for use by general UTAU users.

Experimental recording script (No. 10000 - 10199)

**What is this?** - this document is an experimental Arpasing recording script consisting of 200 phrases selected from public-domain books collected by the Project Gutenberg.

**Does it perform better than the original 220-line script?** - the performance largely depends on the quality of the recorded voice, which in turns (partially) depends on the ease of pronunciation. The purpose of designing this phrase-based script is to reduce recording efforts. Whether or not it will work yet has to be tested.

**Do I have to read through the whole script?** - no. The first 65 lines are expected to make it sound as good as the original 220-line script (No. 00000 - 00219). It is also expected that the more you record, the better it will sound, if the recording quality doesn’t degrade towards the end due to human fatigue.

**Does it perform better than the original 220-line script?** - the performance largely depends on the quality of the recorded voice, which in turns (partially) depends on the ease of pronunciation. The purpose of designing this phrase-based script is to reduce recording efforts. Whether or not it will work yet has to be tested.

**Do I have to read through the whole script?** - no. The first 95 lines are expected to make it sound as good as the original 220-line script (No. 00000 - 00219).
